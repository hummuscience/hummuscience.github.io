### Problems with the usage of non-scheduled psychedelics for animal research {#problems-with-the-usage-of-non-scheduled-psychedelics-for-animal-research}

Due to the fact that classic psychedelics were scheduled, scientists
used other compounds instead for animal research, such as [DOI]({{< relref "../notes/20220405103750-doi.md" >}}). The
issue with that are twofolds:

1.  There is little human data on the usage of such alternatives (such
    as DOI), neither in a clinical setting or recreational use.
2.  The pharmacology of these compounds differs. While, for example,
    both DOI and [LSD]({{< relref "20210518184927-lysergic_acid_diethylamide_lsd.md" >}}) bind to the [5-HT2A-receptor]({{< relref "../notes/20220405104217-5_ht2a_receptor.md" >}}) and the
    [5-HT2C-receptor]({{< relref "../notes/20220405104300-5_ht2c_receptor.md" >}}), DOI does not bind to other receptors that might
    influence the effects of compounds.
