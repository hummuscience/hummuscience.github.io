    description: This study investigates how we sense warmth through specialized neurons. By examining over 20,000 mouse sensory neurons, we found that two ion channels (TRPV1 and TRPM2) play distinct roles in temperature detection. TRPV1 helps with quick warm sensing, while TRPM2 influences how many neurons respond to warmth. These findings help explain how animals make decisions about temperature preferences and maintain thermal comfort.

# Bio

By day I am Neuroscientist that studies psychedelics and animal behavior. On weekends you might find me at a rave giving a harm-reduction talk.

This website is my digital playground where I share... well, everything! You'll find posts about my research, thoughts on neuroscience, travel stories, food adventures, and whatever else catches my interest. Think of it as my alternative to social media – a place where I can share ideas and connect without the usual platform restrictions.

I love exploring the intersections between science, society, and everyday life. So whether you're a fellow scientist, a curious mind, or just someone who stumbled upon this site – welcome! Let's learn and explore together
