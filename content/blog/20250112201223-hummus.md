I have opinions, some of them quite strong ones. And one opinion that I seem to not be able to change is that there is **rubbish** hummus in Germany.

Every once in a while, a dear and well-intentioned friend&nbsp;[^fn:1] will approach me with this great hummu place they have discovered in XY-city that I should try. And so, I add it to my  ["To Try" map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/snpkXVtkL7U2gJ4Y7) and once I am in the area, I will give it a try. Apart from that, there are those times where someone brings some home-made hummus with them to a party I stumble onto a place by chance while walking through a city...

Sadly, I haven't found a place that I genuinniley like. Now before you think that I am just some snobbish, judgemental and entitled person, I can assure you, I **also** suck at making hummus. In fact, I would probably rate my best attempt as an optimistic 5/10.

Why is the standard so high? What is it hard to make good hummus? What the heck is **good** hummus? And is there a place somewhere in europe that is actually good? In an attempt to turn my ramblings at parties or during lunch into something more constructive, I thought I will put this post together to write some thoughts, highlight some places with fantastic hummus, some places I have tried and document my attempts to make ~~great~~ better hummus.


## Why is Hummus so important? {#why-is-hummus-so-important}

Where I come from, it is impossible to imagine a meal without a plate of hummus and fresh pita bread&nbsp;[^fn:2]. Its a simple arrangements, you take some hummus from the plastic container it usually comes in (yes, we buy it), put it in the center of a plate, take a big spoon, press it into the center and then rotate the plate while pointing the soon to the outside. When done, add some olive oil, maybe some daqqa&nbsp;[^fn:3], boiled chickpeas in the middle and sprinkel with some paprika/cumin powder and parsley if you feel fancy.

Contrary to common belief, we actually **never** made Hummus ourselves at home. After asking around, it seems that my family wasn't special with this. Why bother? There are places that specialize in making hummus. Daily. Fresh, warm, and they sell it in the kilos. On top of that, these places are so good that any "home made" hummus I ate in the middle east was a weak imitation at best. This is also the problem with these places. Once you ate there, they become your comparison, and also the bane of your hummus-existence (mine at least), chasing that taste through europe &gt;.&lt;

I would like to mention the three places that defined my hummus palette. If you ever have a chance to visit there, DO IT!


## Temples of Hummus {#temples-of-hummus}


### Hummus Lul - Tira, Israel/Palestine[^fn:4] {#hummus-lul-tira-israel-palestine}


### Hummuas Abu Nidal - Tul Karem - West Bank {#hummuas-abu-nidal-tul-karem-west-bank}

A bit towards the south-east of the Tul Karem old town, coming from the direction of Taybe and Irtah. A small place, not very obvious, except by the line in front of it.

The original owner of the place (Abu Nidal) learned how to make Hummus in Nablus&nbsp;[^fn:5] in 1960s. In 1971, he decided to get open his own place and moved to Tul Karem. First with a small shop int he Tul Karem refugee camp, he later moved to the current location where the shop has been a peoples favorite for the past 40+ years! Sadly, Abu Nidal died in 2013, but the place continues to be ran by his previous workes. It even seems like it expanded with a second branch close the to municipality building!

One thing that always fascinated me with Abu Nidal is their that they always "finished" the hummus freshly. For sure, they would also prepare the hummus in large food processors before, but you could always watch them over the counter while they added some hot water and parsley and then [mix it by hand before serving you a plate.](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=165894328970621)

For some people, Abu Nidal rings another bell.

[^fn:1]: You know who you are. I still love you. Keep sending me suggestions for Hummus places to try in Berlin &lt;3
[^fn:2]: Another topic that I could write a whole blogpost about. I can't wait for the "islamisierung der abendlandes" so I can finally enjoy some good pita bread.
[^fn:3]: Daqqa, **not** dukka. Its some form of relish/sauce made out of lemon juie, garlic and chillies. Think of it as a more watered-down [Zhug](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-chug_(Sauce)), more green than red. Funnily, I don't like it. But the majority of people love it!
[^fn:4]: I will refer to this place as Israel/Palestine. Sometimes I will call it "the holy land" or "the land". Maybe I will also let a "Canaan" slip in between.
[^fn:5]: A larger city in the North-East of Tul Karem known for its Knafeh
